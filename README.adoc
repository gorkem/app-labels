= Guidelines for Labels and Annotations for OpenShift applications

Guidelines for labels and annotation that are recognized by OpenShift ecosystem.
These labels and annotations do not affect the way applications are deployed and
run but they are highly recommended.


== How to generate the docs

Convert the AsciiDoc to PDF and HTML using Asciidoctor by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ ./mvnw

IMPORTANT: You need to install `graphviz` for the diagrams to show.

Open the file _target/generated-docs/labels-annotation-for-openshift.pdf_ or _target/generated-docs/labels-annotation-for-openshift.html_
